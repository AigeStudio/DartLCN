As of Dart 2, pub no longer supports `pub build`, `pub serve`, or transformers.
They're replaced by the **build system**,
which includes the **build_runner** tool.

从 Dart 2 开始，pub 不再支持 `pub build`、`pub serve` 以及变换器。
它们均由 **build_runner** 工具中的 **build system** 替代。

For information about building and serving apps in Dart 2, see the following:
